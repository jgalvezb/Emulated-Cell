About the library

The cell emulation project is a software tha will emulate all functions of a living cell.

The goal of this project is to mimic all functions and chemical reactions of a living cell to a point that it could show the protein production changes with a particular change on a gene in the cell DNA.

The cell could be started with any DNA sequence and from any species.
